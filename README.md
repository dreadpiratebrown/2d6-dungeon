## Decisions

## To Do

- Write combat logic
  - potions & scrolls
  - special effects from enemies
  - mishap & prime attack damage - automatic?
  - refactor combat logic so I don't need MISS buttons
- Call on the gods
- Way to initiate combat manually
- Figure out a way to load room data by file (level one, level two, etc.)
- POLT1 (generic tables) 11 - roll on patrol table - how to get around this?
- reference tables like Armour, Magic Scrolls, etc.
- write debugging scripts - preset hero, all doors are locked, etc.
- town component
- special/extra tables?
- levelling up
- auto roll & save money amounts?
- Add notes to rooms?
- Add Alarm Check to tools.
- TESTS?
